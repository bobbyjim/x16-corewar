	* Optimized MOV.I implementation
	* Optimized endgame: If the warriors have more processes than cycles 
	  left, no warrior is able to die, therefore a tie is inevitable.
	* Optimization: rearanged insn_t structure to prevent aliasing
	* a and b-mode reorganized
	* some other minor changes

	* Removed ABORT_TIES_EARLY.  Ugly.
	* Removed GPL.  Now Public Domain, except exhaust.c
	  which contains the functions npos() and posit() from pMARS 0.9.2.
	* Added P-space.
	* (reminder) exhaust.c is a mess.  clean it up.
	* Added multiwarrior battles to exhaust.c.

	* Added compile-time selectable option ABORT_TIES_EARLY that
	  abort ties early when possible.  Tests indicate that only
	  select warriors will benefit.  Mostly it deteriorates
	  performance.
