The ICWS
tournament is traditionally run under the following conditions:

a) Standard: ICWS'88
b) Core Size: 8192
c) Maximum Number of Cycles before declaring a tie: 100 000
   (a machine cycle executes one instruction from each warrior)
d) Maximum Number of Tasks per warrior: 64
e) Warrior Size Limit: 64 instructions (1/128th of core size)
f) Six rounds of one-on-one, round-robin play.  Each warrior plays three
   rounds as the initially executing warrior, three mirror rounds as the
   warrior executing second.  Three load addresses are chosen at random
   such that the second warrior starts loading no closer than 64
   instructions (1/128th of core size) to the first.
g) Scoring is 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and no points for
   a loss.
h) The program with the best total score is declared the tournament winner.
